# Great Lakes Temperature Analysis (2022 & 2020)

## ðŸ“„ Description

This C program analyzes daily surface water temperature data for six of North America's Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, Ontario, and St. Clair) from two separate years â€” **2022** and **2020**. The data is read from text files and the program answers a series of questions involving averages, extremes, seasonal comparisons, and temperature-based activity potential (like swimming).

## âœ… Features

The program performs the following operations:

### Question 1:

* Calculates **average annual temperatures** for each lake and for all six combined (2022 data).

### Question 2:

* Identifies the **coldest and warmest lakes** based on annual averages.
* Lists lakes **above and below** the combined average.

### Question 3:

* Reports the **coldest and warmest days** (with actual dates) for each lake in 2022.

### Question 4:

* Determines the **overall coldest and warmest temperatures** among all six lakes and their respective dates.

### Question 5:

* Computes **average summer (June 20 â€“ Sept 21)** temperatures for each lake.

### Question 6:

* Computes **average winter (Dec 20 â€“ Mar 20)** temperatures for each lake.

### Question 7:

* Counts the number of **swimming days** (days with temperatures > 20Â°C) for each lake.

### Question 8:

* Counts the number of **frozen days** (temperatures < 0Â°C) for each lake.

### Question 9:

* Compares **2022 and 2020 average temperatures** for each lake and reports the **differences** in a tabular format.
